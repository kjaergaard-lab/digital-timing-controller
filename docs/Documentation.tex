\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
This document describes the design and operation of the digital pattern generator (DPG)-based imaging controller used in the Kj{\ae}rgaard lab.  While both this controller and its predecessor are implemented using a field-programmable gate array (FPGA), namely the Xlinx Spartan 3AN development board, the DPG imaging controller has a much simpler FPGA architecture and is more easily customizable than the previous, bespoke version.

Whereas the previous imaging controller had many different modules, each of which controlled a different aspect of the timing sequence, the DPG solution has only two modules: the DPG itself and a module to generate triggers for the FlexDDS.  The reason that these are separate is that we need millions of triggers for the FlexDDS at a fixed rate and duty cycle, and using a DPG to generate these would require an enormous amount of memory.  It is easier to use a dedicated module for this purpose.

	\caption{Diagram of the DPG-based imaging controller. A PC transmits parameters to the FlexDDS trigger generator and a digital pattern to the DPG.  The sequence starts either when an input trigger is received or when a software trigger is issued by the host PC over serial.  Thick red lines indicate the transmission of information to and from the serial controller.}

\section{Digital Pattern Generator (DPG)}
\label{sec:dpg}
A DPG is simple to understand -- it is a device that stores a list of digital output patterns and the times at which they should be enacted.  In the case of the current DPG, these are stored as a series of 40-bit (5 byte) instructions, where the most-significant byte (MSB) is the type of instruction and bytes 0 to 3 (for a total of 32 bits) are the \emph{data}.  There are currently three types of instructions:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item $\mathrm{MSB} = 0\mathrm{x}00$ This instruction tells the DPG to wait for a time equal to \emph{data} sample clock cycles.
	\item $\mathrm{MSB} = 0\mathrm{x}01$ This instruction tells the DPG to output the pattern equal to \emph{data}.
	\item $\mathrm{MSB} = 0\mathrm{x}02$ This instruction tells the DPG to wait for a digital input event before continuing to the next instruction.  Bits 0 to 3 of \emph{data}, interpreted as an unsigned integer, indicate the digital input channel to look at, and bits 8 to 9 indicate the type of edge to look for.
\end{enumerate}

New instructions are requested when a ``start'' command is received and also whenever a sample clock HIGH is detected.  When all instructions are read, the FSM returns to state 0, as well as when a sequence ``stop'' command is received.}
